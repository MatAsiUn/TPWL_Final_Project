# TPWL_Final_Project

## GitHub configuration

Welcome to our MA4N1 project. Our project is contained in the file called TPWLFinalProject.lean

Each person also has their own file, these files contain each person's rough work. The format we followed was that each person worked on their code in their personal section before pushing the completed code to the main file. The content of the project is completely contained within the TPWLFinalProject file. 

The file begins with some ancillary theorems necessary for the proof, and then proceeds with the proof. First proving existence, then using existence to prove uniqueness. After the proof, we prove some corollaries of Riesz's theorem.

We are happy for the group to be given a joint mark for the project (we do not want it to be marked individually).
